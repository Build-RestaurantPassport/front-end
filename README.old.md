      Notes for the team: by Scott Fuston

      * All styels are controlled form 'styles/styleVars', from there the vars map into 'globalStyles' where I have some basic components set up. heading tags,raphs anchors etc.. they a are all dynamic. they all can take bgColor, color and some fontSize props or you can control defaults from styleVars.

      * At the top of globalStyles I used createGlobalStyle to set basic global styles like 'body' and '*'. This also where we would include a 'reset' if you want to.
